# Automated Forensics Orchestrator for Amazon EC2

Automated Forensics Orchestrator for Amazon EC2 is a self-service AWS Solution implementation that enterprise customers can deploy to quickly set up and configure an automated orchestration workflow that enables their Security Operations Centre (SOC) to capture and examine data from EC2 instances and attached volumes as evidence for forensic analysis, in the event of a potential security breach. It will orchestrate the forensics process from the point at which a threat is first detected, enable isolation of the affected EC2 instances and data volumes, capture memory and disk images to secure storage, and trigger automated actions or tools for investigation and analysis of such artefacts. All the while, the solution will notify and report on its progress, status, and findings. It will enable SOC to continuously discover and analyze patterns of fraudulent activities across multi-account and multi-region environments. The solution will leverage native AWS services and be underpinned by a highly available, resilient, and serverless architecture, security, and operational monitoring features.

Digital forensics is a 4 step process of triaging, acquisition, analysis and reporting. Automated Forensics framework provides capability to enterprise to act on security event by imaging or acquisition of breached resource for examination and generate forensic report about the security breach. In the event of a security breach, it will enable customers to easily to capture and examine required targeted data for forsensic’s storage and analysis. This solution framework enables security operations centre to discover and analyse patterns of fraudulent activities. The automated forensics solution will provide a multi-account and a multi-region [“solution”] built using native AWS services.

## Build your Forensic Orchestrator CDK project

Once you have initialized the repository, you can make changes to the code. As you work through the development process, the following commands may be useful for periodic testing and/or formal testing once development is completed. These commands are CDK-related and should be run at the /source level of your project.

CDK commands:

-   `cdk init` - creates a new, empty CDK project that can be used with your AWS account.
-   `cdk synth` - synthesizes and prints the CloudFormation template generated from your CDK project to the CLI.
-   `cdk deploy` - deploys your CDK project into your AWS account. Useful for validating a full build run as well as performing functional/integration testing
    of the solution architecture.

Additional scripts related to building, testing, and cleaning-up assets may be found in the `package.json` file or in similar locations for your selected CDK language. You can also run `cdk -h` in the terminal for details on additional commands.

---

## Run Unit Tests

### Prerequisites

Python version 3.8.x. We recommend setting up [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

### Tests for Python code of the lambdas

-   `make help` lists all the command
-   `make virtualenv` creates a Python virtualenv for development
-   `source .venv/bin/activate` activates the virtual environment
-   `make test` runs the test (includes format, lint and static check)
-   `make fmt` only runs format
-   `make lint` only runs lint
-   `make install` installs all dependency
-   `make lock-version` locks the version if there is any latest version dependency (e.g no version specified)
-   `make check-py-version` a prerequisite for build execution, is relied upon by tasks `test` and `virtualenv`

The `/source/run-all-tests.sh` script is the centralized script for running all unit, integration, and snapshot tests for both the CDK project as well as any associated Lambda functions or other source code packages.

_Note_: It is the developer's responsibility to ensure that all test commands are called in this script, and that it is kept up to date.

This script is called from the solution build scripts to ensure that specified tests are passing while performing build, validation and publishing tasks via the pipeline.
